### Codes for CPL attacks

## This is the prototype code for ESORICS 2020 A Framework for Evaluating Gradient Leakage Attacks in Federated Learning.


## Here is a brief description of each file.
# LFW_Deep_Leakage_from_Gradients.ipynb: lfw implementation for DLG attack in (NIPS2019) "Deep leakage from gradients."
# LFW_enhanced_random_ASR.ipynb: CPL attack with geometric initialization
# LFW_batch.ipynb: CPL attack in batch
# LFW128_enhanced_random_ASR.ipynb: CPL attack with resolution 128*128. Same applies to LFW64_enhanced_random_ASR.ipynb
# LFW_defense.ipynb: CPL attack under high-pass filter and additive noise
