## Codes for CPL attacks

This is the prototype code for ESORICS 2020 A Framework for Evaluating Gradient Leakage Attacks in Federated Learning. The talk can be found here:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNGpv4AW80g" target="_blank">talk</a>.


### Here is a brief description of each file.
LFW_Deep_Leakage_from_Gradients.ipynb: lfw implementation for DLG attack in (NIPS2019) "Deep leakage from gradients."

LFW_enhanced_random_ASR.ipynb: CPL attack with geometric initialization

LFW_batch.ipynb: CPL attack in batch

LFW128_enhanced_random_ASR.ipynb: CPL attack with resolution 128*128. Same applies to LFW64_enhanced_random_ASR.ipynb

LFW_defense.ipynb: CPL attack under high-pass filter and additive noise
